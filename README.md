Project Title: Personality Prediction System via CV Analysis

Internship: CodeClause Internship (Artificial Intelligence Domain - Golden Level)




* Description:

This project aims to predict a person's personality trait based on the textual content of their CV/resume using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

It extracts text from a resume (PDF format), converts it into features using TF-IDF vectorization, and then predicts personality types like Extrovert, Introvert, Agreeable, Conscientious, and Open using a trained classification model.


*  Technologies Used:

- Python
- PyPDF2
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- TF-IDF Vectorizer (NLP)
- Naive Bayes Classifier (ML)



* How to Run:

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Install required libraries
3. Add your resume (PDF format) to the `cv_input_samples/` folder and rename it to `sanvee_resume.pdf`.
4. Run the model training script (only once)
5. Predict the personality type from your CV
